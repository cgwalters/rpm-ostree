# We have no business accessing /var/roothome or /var/home.  In general
# the ostree design clearly avoids touching those, but since systemd offers
# us easy tools to toggle on protection, let's use them.  In the future
# it'd be nice to do something like using DynamicUser=yes for the main service,
# and have a system rpm-ostreed-transaction.service that runs privileged
# but as a subprocess.
ProtectHome=true
# Explicitly list paths here which we should never access.  The initial
# entry here ensures that the skopeo process we fork won't interact with
# application containers.

# Significantly bump this timeout from the default because
# we do a lot of stuff on daemon startup.
