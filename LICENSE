rpm-ostree includes code licensed under GPLv2+, LGPLv2+, (Apache 2.0 OR MIT).
More specifically, the code in `rust/` is under `Apache 2.0 or MIT`, and
the C code (in `src/` mostly) is under a mix of GPLv2+ or LGPLv2+.
See these license files:

 - COPYING.GPL
 - COPYING.LGPL
 - rust/LICENSE-APACHE
 - rust/LICENSE-MIT

Most of our source files have either a license header or a SPDX license identifier.

The original intention for rpm-ostree was to match libostree as being LGPLv2+;
this would ensure code could be easily shared between the two, as well as other
LGPLv2+ projects like glib.

However [due to an accident](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1890),
some GPLv2+ code was imported, and we're unlikely to easily change that now.

The rationale for having the Rust code be `Apache 2.0 OR MIT` is to match
most of the Rust ecosystem, so we can easily share it there.
